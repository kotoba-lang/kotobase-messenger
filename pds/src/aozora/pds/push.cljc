(ns aozora.pds.push
  "Best-effort Web Push fan-out for new messages (ADR: push-notifications
  plan). Wired ONLY into aozora.pds.convo/send-message — NOT into
  send-key-distribution: a sender-key distribution always co-occurs with an
  actual send-message call in the same user action (aozora.pds.convo's
  send-key-distribution docstring; yoro-ui.interop.signal-group's
  ensure-sender-key! runs as a pre-send check immediately before the visible
  message), so pushing on both would double-notify the same recipients for
  one logical event. The message's own push already covers it.

  Fire-and-forget from the caller: every failure here (missing VAPID config,
  an expired subscription, a network error) is caught and logged, never
  thrown — a push failure must never fail or delay the authoritative write."
