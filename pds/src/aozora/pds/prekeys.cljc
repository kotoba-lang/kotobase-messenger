(ns aozora.pds.prekeys
  "app.aozora.convo.registerPrekeys write handler.

  A signed X25519 prekey bundle (identity key + signed prekey + one-time-
  prekey pool) for full X3DH E2E session establishment (see
  yoro-ui.interop.signal). One record per actor under a fixed rkey —
  re-registering (e.g. on prekey rotation) replaces the previous bundle
  (including the WHOLE oneTimePreKeys pool) rather than accumulating
  records, the same deterministic-rkey convention aozora.pds.convo/mark-read
  uses. oneTimePreKeys is NOT per-fetch-consumed the way a stateful prekey
  server tracks OPKs — see the registerPrekeys lexicon's description for why
  (self-sovereign-repo write model has no cross-actor consumption path).

  Single-bundle-per-actor is a real multi-device hazard: signing in on a
  SECOND device silently overwrites the first device's identityKey, breaking
  every peer's existing Double Ratchet session with device 1 without warning
  anyone (no cross-device ratchet-state sync exists — see the messenger
  coverage audit). This handler can't fix that (full multi-device needs
  per-device sessions + fan-out, unbuilt anywhere in kotoba-lang/org-signal
  either), but it CAN stop the silent, undetected part: re-registering with a
  DIFFERENT identityKey than the one already on file is rejected unless the
  caller passes `force true` — an explicit, informed choice, not an accident
  of loading the app on a new browser. Rotating the SAME identityKey's
  signedPreKey (the normal 7-day rotation in yoro-ui.interop.signal/
  ensure-identity!) is always allowed — same device, same identity, no risk."
